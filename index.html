      <p>The goal of the game is to find all 5 pairs of cards as quickly as possible. The player that finds the greatest number of pairs, wins.<br>
        To begin playing, the player whose name is highlighted can clickany card in the card pile. It will flip over and reveal a picture of a Power Ranger.
        Click another card. If they match, they will disappear and you will have completed a match! If they dont, you'll have three seconds to look at them
        before they flip back over. Then it's time for the other player to try!<br>
        AFter you play, you'll see the name of the final winner and how long it took to win the game.</p>
