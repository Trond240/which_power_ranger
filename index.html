            The player that finds the greatest numbers of pairs, wins.<br><br>

            To begin playing, the player whose name is highlighted can click any card
            in the card pile. It will flip over and reveal a picture of a Power Ranger.
            click another card. If they match, they will disapear and you will have com-
            pleted a match! If they don't, you'll have three seconds to look at them before
            thry flip back over. Then it's time for the other player to try!<br><br>

            After you play, you'll see the name of the final winner and how and how long it
            took to win the game.</p>
